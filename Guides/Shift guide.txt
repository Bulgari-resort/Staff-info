Shifts are promotion time!!!!

Host---- This person needs to see people working hard.
Co-Host -------- This person is usually the ranker. They rank the people and do the group shout.
(Optional) You can Host on your own.
Ranker------- If there is a second ranker ingame or the host decided to do it alone then this is the rankers rank


How to start a shift. First make sure a ranker is ingame for the shift and then go the countdown command by saying ;countdown 1800 meaning it will start a countdown for 30 mins

In a shift find people working well and then tell the management to rank them.
Once a shift has finished it is over.

Times when a shift IS ok (Note: Hosting a shift illegaly means you will have shift permissons revoked)
If a management is online and knows it is happening.

Remember that by hosting a shift you will be crowded.
