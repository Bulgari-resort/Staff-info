Trainer guide


Hello everyone I am (Name) I will be your trainer

I will teach you all you need to know about Parked pizza

If you need to go AFK please inform me

You get 3 minutes of AFK time

If I go afk or disconnect please wait for me. If I am gone for 5 minutes inform the host about my absence

Is everyone ready?

Any questions?

Ok. So there are 2 jobs that can be filled by an LR chef and server. MR can supervise but are recommended to help LR cook and serve because supervising will not get an MR promotion.
To cook you interact with certain items. Check the recipes button.
When you are serving you tell the chefs what the customer wants. If we are understaffed then you will take the order and cook.
Questions.
Q1 What is NOT a way to be promoted?
Q2 What happens if we are understaffed
Q3 What do you do to cook
Q4 What jobs do LR do ingame?

If they passed say Congrats you passed
If they fail say Sorry you failed.
Failing is if they get 2 questions wrong.
(Bring them to a ranker. leave once a ranker comes to them)
